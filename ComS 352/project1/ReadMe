A shell implementation by Christian Shinkle.

The overview of the shell consists of taking in input, parsing it (possibly multiple times),
and passing the parsed tokens to execvp() to execute the system call. 

For the main, it consists of setting up all variables needed running in three loops:
the outer loop, and the inner (statement) loop. 

The outer loop is only responsible for running the inner two loops until the user 
enters "exit", which end the loop and the program as a whole, and for taking in input
using fgets(). This input is then stored in the line variable and used for parsing.

The inner loop is responsible for parsing line into statements seperated by semi colons.
Each statement is treated as an individual command and will be ran according to specifications.
Most commands are handled through the runCommand() function. After each command is finished,
they are stored in a circular queue int order to be retrieved by the history command.
